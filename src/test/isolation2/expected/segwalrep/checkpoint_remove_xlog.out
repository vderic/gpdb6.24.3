-- generate another temporarily orphaned prepared transaction. the PREPARE
-- transaction xlog will be located on a different xlog segment file than the
-- one that has the previous orphaned prepared transaction. Previously there is
-- a bug: after crash recovery finishes, the startup process will create an
-- end-of-recovery checkpoint. the checkpoint will recycle/remove xlog files
-- according to orphaned prepared transaction LSNs, replication slot data, some
-- related GUC values, etc. The orphaned prepared transaction LSN data
-- (TwoPhaseState->prepXacts, etc) for checkpoint are populated in startup
-- process RecoverPreparedTransactions(), but the function is called after the
-- end-of-recovery checkpoint creation so xlog files with orphaned prepared
-- transactions could be recycled/removed. this might cause "requested WAL
-- segment pg_xlog/000000010000000000000009 has already been removed" kind of
-- error when bringing up the primary during single postgres running in
-- 'gprecoverseg -a -v' pg_rewind if failover happens).
-- As to why we need the new orphaned prepared transaction on another xlog
-- file?  If a xlog file was opened, even the file is unlinked, we could still
-- read the file with the file descriptor, so to reproduce this issue we need
-- PrescanPreparedTransactions(), which scans all xlog files that have prepared
-- transaction before the end-of-recovery creation, closes the opened file
-- descriptor of the xlog file that includes the first orphaned prepared
-- transation and thus later RecoverPreparedTransactions() will fail when
-- opening the missing xlog file that has the first orphaned prepared
-- transaction.  Refer xlogutils.c:XLogRead() for context.
