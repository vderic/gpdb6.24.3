title: Using Greenplum MapReduce 
---

MapReduce is a programming model developed by Google for processing and generating large data sets on an array of commodity servers. Greenplum MapReduce allows programmers who are familiar with the MapReduce model to write map and reduce functions and submit them to the Greenplum Database parallel engine for processing.

You configure a Greenplum MapReduce job via a YAML-formatted configuration file, then pass the file to the Greenplum MapReduce program, `gpmapreduce`, for execution by the Greenplum Database parallel engine. The Greenplum Database system distributes the input data, runs the program across a set of machines, handles machine failures, and manages the required inter-machine communication.

Refer to [gpmapreduce](../../../utility_guide/ref/gpmapreduce.html) for details about running the Greenplum MapReduce program.

## <a id="topic2"></a>About the Greenplum MapReduce Configuration File 

This section explains some basics of the Greenplum MapReduce configuration file format to help you get started creating your own Greenplum MapReduce configuration files. Greenplum uses the [YAML 1.1](http://yaml.org/spec/1.1/) document format and then implements its own schema for defining the various steps of a MapReduce job.

All Greenplum MapReduce configuration files must first declare the version of the YAML specification they are using. After that, three dashes \(`---`\) denote the start of a document, and three dots \(`...`\) indicate the end of a document without starting a new one. \(A document in this context is equivalent to a MapReduce job.\) Comment lines are prefixed with a pound symbol \(`#`\). You can declare multiple Greenplum MapReduce documents/jobs in the same file:

```
%YAML 1.1
---
# Begin Document 1
# ...
---
# Begin Document 2
# ...
```

Within a Greenplum MapReduce document, there are three basic types of data structures or *nodes*: *scalars*, *sequences* and *mappings*.

A *scalar* is a basic string of text indented by a space. If you have a scalar input that spans multiple lines, a preceding pipe \( `|` \) denotes a *literal* style, where all line breaks are significant. Alternatively, a preceding angle bracket \( `>` \) folds a single line break to a space for subsequent lines that have the same indentation level. If a string contains characters that have reserved meaning, the string must be quoted or the special character must be escaped with a backslash \( `\` \).

```
# Read each new line literally
somekey: |   this value contains two lines
   and each line is read literally
# Treat each new line as a space
anotherkey: >
   this value contains two lines
   but is treated as one continuous line
# This quoted string contains a special character
ThirdKey: "This is a string: not a mapping"
```

A *sequence* is a list with each entry in the list on its own line denoted by a dash and a space \(`-`\). Alternatively, you can specify an inline sequence as a comma-separated list within square brackets. A sequence provides a set of data and gives it an order. When you load a list into the Greenplum MapReduce program, the order is kept.

```
# list sequence
- this
- is
- a list
- with
- five scalar values
# inline sequence
[this, is, a list, with, five scalar values]
```

A *mapping* is used to pair up data values with identifiers called *keys*. Mappings use a colon and space \(`:`\) for each `key: value` pair, or can also be specified inline as a comma-separated list within curly braces. The *key* is used as an index for retrieving data from a mapping.

```
# a mapping of items
title: War and Peace
author: Leo Tolstoy
date: 1865
# same mapping written inline
{title: War and Peace, author: Leo Tolstoy, date: 1865}
```

Keys are used to associate meta information with each node and specify the expected node type \(*scalar*, *sequence* or *mapping*\).

The Greenplum MapReduce program processes the nodes of a document in order and uses indentation \(spaces\) to determine the document hierarchy and the relationships of the nodes to one another. The use of white space is significant. White space should not be used simply for formatting purposes, and tabs should not be used at all.

Refer to [gpmapreduce.yaml](../../../utility_guide/ref/gpmapreduce-yaml.html) for detailed information about the Greenplum MapReduce configuration file format and the keys and values supported.

## <a id="topic59"></a>Example Greenplum MapReduce Job 

In this example, you create a MapReduce job that processes text documents and reports on the number of occurrences of certain keywords in each document. The documents and keywords are stored in separate Greenplum Database tables that you create as part of the exercise.

This example MapReduce job utilizes the untrusted `plpythonu` language; as such, you must run the job as a user with Greenplum Database administrative privileges.

1.  Log in to the Greenplum Database master host as the `gpadmin` administrative user and set up your environment. For example:

    ```
    $ ssh gpadmin@<gpmaster>
    gpadmin@gpmaster$ . /usr/local/greenplum-db/greenplum_path.sh
    ```

2.  Create a new database for the MapReduce example: For example:

    ```
    gpadmin@gpmaster$ createdb mapredex_db
    ```

3.  Start the `psql` subsystem, connecting to the new database:

    ```
    gpadmin@gpmaster$ psql -d mapredex_db
    ```

4.  Register the PL/Python language in the database. For example:

    ```
    mapredex_db=> CREATE EXTENSION plpythonu;
    ```

5.  Create the `documents` table and add some data to the table. For example:

    ```
    CREATE TABLE documents (doc_id int, url text, data text);
    INSERT INTO documents VALUES (1, 'http:/url/1', 'this is one document in the corpus');
    INSERT INTO documents VALUES (2, 'http:/url/2', 'i am the second document in the corpus');
    INSERT INTO documents VALUES (3, 'http:/url/3', 'being third never really bothered me until now');
    INSERT INTO documents VALUES (4, 'http:/url/4', 'the document before me is the third document');
    ```

6.  Create the `keywords` table and add some data to the table. For example:

    ```
    CREATE TABLE keywords (keyword_id int, keyword text);
    INSERT INTO keywords VALUES (1, 'the');
    INSERT INTO keywords VALUES (2, 'document');
    INSERT INTO keywords VALUES (3, 'me');
    INSERT INTO keywords VALUES (4, 'being');
    INSERT INTO keywords VALUES (5, 'now');
    INSERT INTO keywords VALUES (6, 'corpus');
    INSERT INTO keywords VALUES (7, 'is');
    INSERT INTO keywords VALUES (8, 'third');
    ```

7.  Construct the MapReduce YAML configuration file. For example, open a file named `mymrjob.yaml` in the editor of your choice and copy/paste the following large text block:

    ```
    # This example MapReduce job processes documents and looks for keywords in them.
    # It takes two database tables as input:
    # - documents (doc_id integer, url text, data text)
    # - keywords (keyword_id integer, keyword text)#
    # The documents data is searched for occurrences of keywords and returns results of
    # url, data and keyword (a keyword can be multiple words, such as "high performance # computing")
    %YAML 1.1
