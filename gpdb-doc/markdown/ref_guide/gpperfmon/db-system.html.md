title: system_* 
---

The `system_*` tables store system utilization metrics. There are three system tables, all having the same columns:

-   `system_now` is an external table whose data files are stored in `$MASTER_DATA_DIRECTORY/gpperfmon/data`. Current system utilization data is stored in `system_now` during the period between data collection from the `gpperfmon` agents and automatic commitment to the `system_history` table.
-   `system_tail` is an external table whose data files are stored in `$MASTER_DATA_DIRECTORY/gpperfmon/data`. This is a transitional table for system utilization data that has been cleared from `system_now` but has not yet been committed to `system_history`. It typically only contains a few minutes worth of data.
-   `system_history` is a regular table that stores historical system utilization metrics. It is pre-partitioned into monthly partitions. Partitions are automatically added in two month increments as needed.
