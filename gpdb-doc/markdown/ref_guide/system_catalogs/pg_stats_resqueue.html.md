title: pg_stat_resqueues 
---

> **Note** The `pg_stat_resqueues` view is valid only when resource queue-based resource management is active.

The `pg_stat_resqueues` view allows administrators to view metrics about a resource queue's workload over time. To allow statistics to be collected for this view, you must enable the `stats_queue_level` server configuration parameter on the Greenplum Database master instance. Enabling the collection of these metrics does incur a small performance penalty, as each statement submitted through a resource queue must be logged in the system catalog tables.
