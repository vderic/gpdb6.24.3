title: pg_stat_all_indexes 
---

The `pg_stat_all_indexes` view shows one row for each index in the current database that displays statistics about accesses to that specific index.

The `pg_stat_user_indexes` and `pg_stat_sys_indexes` views contain the same information, but filtered to only show user and system indexes respectively.

In Greenplum Database 6, the `pg_stat_*_indexes` views display access statistics for indexes only from the master instance. Access statistics from segment instances are ignored. You can create views that display usage statistics that combine statistics from the master and the segment instances, see [Index Access Statistics from the Master and Segment Instances](#index_stats_all_6x).

|Column|Type|Description|
|------|----|-----------|
|`relid`|oid|OID of the table for this index|
|`indexrelid`|oid|OID of this index|
|`schemaname`|name|Name of the schema this index is in|
|`relname`|name|Name of the table for this index|
|`indexrelname`|name|Name of this index|
|`idx_scan`|bigint|Total number of index scans initiated on this index from all segment instances|
|`idx_tup_read`|bigint|Number of index entries returned by scans on this index|
|`idx_tup_fetch`|bigint|Number of live table rows fetched by simple index scans using this index|

## <a id="index_stats_all_6x"></a>Index Access Statistics from the Master and Segment Instances 

To display index access statistics that combine statistics from the master and the segment instances you can create these views. A user requires `SELECT` privilege on the views to use them.
