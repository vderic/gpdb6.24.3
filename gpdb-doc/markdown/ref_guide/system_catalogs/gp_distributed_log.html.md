title: gp_distributed_log 
---

The `gp_distributed_log` view contains status information about distributed transactions and their associated local transactions. A distributed transaction is a transaction that involves modifying data on the segment instances. Greenplum's distributed transaction manager ensures that the segments stay in synch. This view allows you to see the status of distributed transactions.
