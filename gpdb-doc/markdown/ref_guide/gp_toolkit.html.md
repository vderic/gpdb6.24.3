title: The gp_toolkit Administrative Schema 
---

Greenplum Database provides an administrative schema called `gp_toolkit` that you can use to query the system catalogs, log files, and operating environment for system status information. The `gp_toolkit` schema contains a number of views that you can access using SQL commands. The `gp_toolkit` schema is accessible to all database users, although some objects may require superuser permissions. For convenience, you may want to add the `gp_toolkit` schema to your schema search path. For example:

```
=> ALTER ROLE myrole SET search_path TO myschema,gp_toolkit;
```

This documentation describes the most useful views in `gp_toolkit`. You may notice other objects \(views, functions, and external tables\) within the `gp_toolkit` schema that are not described in this documentation \(these are supporting objects to the views described in this section\).

**Warning:** Do not change database objects in the gp\_toolkit schema. Do not create database objects in the schema. Changes to objects in the schema might affect the accuracy of administrative information returned by schema objects. Any changes made in the gp\_toolkit schema are lost when the database is backed up and then restored with the `gpbackup` and `gprestore` utilities.

These are the categories for views in the `gp_toolkit` schema.

## <a id="topic2"></a>Checking for Tables that Need Routine Maintenance 

The following views can help identify tables that need routine table maintenance \(`VACUUM` and/or `ANALYZE`\).

-   [gp\_bloat\_diag](#topic3)
-   [gp\_stats\_missing](#topic4)

The `VACUUM` or `VACUUM FULL` command reclaims disk space occupied by deleted or obsolete rows. Because of the MVCC transaction concurrency model used in Greenplum Database, data rows that are deleted or updated still occupy physical space on disk even though they are not visible to any new transactions. Expired rows increase table size on disk and eventually slow down scans of the table.

The `ANALYZE` command collects column-level statistics needed by the query optimizer. Greenplum Database uses a cost-based query optimizer that relies on database statistics. Accurate statistics allow the query optimizer to better estimate selectivity and the number of rows retrieved by a query operation in order to choose the most efficient query plan.

**Parent topic:** [The gp\_toolkit Administrative Schema](gp_toolkit.html)

### <a id="topic3"></a>gp\_bloat\_diag 

This view shows regular heap-storage tables that have bloat \(the actual number of pages on disk exceeds the expected number of pages given the table statistics\). Tables that are bloated require a `VACUUM` or a `VACUUM FULL` in order to reclaim disk space occupied by deleted or obsolete rows. This view is accessible to all users, however non-superusers will only be able to see the tables that they have permission to access.

> **Note** For diagnostic functions that return append-optimized table information, see [Checking Append-Optimized Tables](#topic8).

|Column|Description|
|------|-----------|
|bdirelid|Table object id.|
|bdinspname|Schema name.|
|bdirelname|Table name.|
|bdirelpages|Actual number of pages on disk.|
|bdiexppages|Expected number of pages given the table data.|
|bdidiag|Bloat diagnostic message.|

### <a id="topic4"></a>gp\_stats\_missing 

This view shows tables that do not have statistics and therefore may require an `ANALYZE` be run on the table.

> **Note** By default, `gp_stats_missing` does not display data for materialized views. Refer to [Including Data for Materialized Views](#topic_matview) for instructions on adding this data to the `gp_stats_missing*` view output.

|Column|Description|
|------|-----------|
|smischema|Schema name.|
|smitable|Table name.|
|smisize|Does this table have statistics? False if the table does not have row count and row sizing statistics recorded in the system catalog, which may indicate that the table needs to be analyzed. This will also be false if the table does not contain any rows. For example, the parent tables of partitioned tables are always empty and will always return a false result.|
|smicols|Number of columns in the table.|
|smirecs|The total number of columns in the table that have statistics recorded.|

## <a id="topic5"></a>Checking for Locks 

When a transaction accesses a relation \(such as a table\), it acquires a lock. Depending on the type of lock acquired, subsequent transactions may have to wait before they can access the same relation. For more information on the types of locks, see "Managing Data" in the *Greenplum Database Administrator Guide*. Greenplum Database resource queues \(used for resource management\) also use locks to control the admission of queries into the system.

The `gp_locks_*` family of views can help diagnose queries and sessions that are waiting to access an object due to a lock.

-   [gp\_locks\_on\_relation](#topic6)
-   [gp\_locks\_on\_resqueue](#topic7)

**Parent topic:** [The gp\_toolkit Administrative Schema](gp_toolkit.html)

### <a id="topic6"></a>gp\_locks\_on\_relation 

This view shows any locks currently being held on a relation, and the associated session information about the query associated with the lock. For more information on the types of locks, see "Managing Data" in the *Greenplum Database Administrator Guide*. This view is accessible to all users, however non-superusers will only be able to see the locks for relations that they have permission to access.

|Column|Description|

## <a id="topic8"></a>Checking Append-Optimized Tables 

The `gp_toolkit` schema includes a set of diagnostic functions you can use to investigate the state of append-optimized tables.

When an append-optimized table \(or column-oriented append-optimized table\) is created, another table is implicitly created, containing metadata about the current state of the table. The metadata includes information such as the number of records in each of the table's segments.

Append-optimized tables may have non-visible rowsâ€”rows that have been updated or deleted, but remain in storage until the table is compacted using `VACUUM`. The hidden rows are tracked using an auxiliary visibility map table, or visimap.

The following functions let you access the metadata for append-optimized and column-oriented tables and view non-visible rows.

For most of the functions, the input argument is `regclass`, either the table `name` or the `oid` of a table.

**Parent topic:** [The gp\_toolkit Administrative Schema](gp_toolkit.html)

### <a id="topic_ylp_gxw_yq"></a>\_\_gp\_aovisimap\_compaction\_info\(oid\) 

This function displays compaction information for an append-optimized table. The information is for the on-disk data files on Greenplum Database segments that store the table data. You can use the information to determine the data files that will be compacted by a `VACUUM` operation on an append-optimized table.

> **Note** Until a VACUUM operation deletes the row from the data file, deleted or updated data rows occupy physical space on disk even though they are hidden to new transactions. The configuration parameter [gp\_appendonly\_compaction](config_params/guc-list.html) controls the functionality of the `VACUUM` command.

This table describes the \_\_gp\_aovisimap\_compaction\_info function output table.

|Column|Description|

## <a id="topic21"></a>Checking Server Configuration Files 

Each component of a Greenplum Database system \(master, standby master, primary segments, and mirror segments\) has its own server configuration file \(`postgresql.conf`\). The following `gp_toolkit` objects can be used to check parameter settings across all primary `postgresql.conf` files in the system:

-   [gp\_param\_setting\('parameter\_name'\)](#topic22)
-   [gp\_param\_settings\_seg\_value\_diffs](#topic23)

**Parent topic:** [The gp\_toolkit Administrative Schema](gp_toolkit.html)

### <a id="topic22"></a>gp\_param\_setting\('parameter\_name'\) 

This function takes the name of a server configuration parameter and returns the `postgresql.conf` value for the master and each active segment. This function is accessible to all users.

|Column|Description|
|------|-----------|
|paramsegment|The segment content id \(only active segments are shown\). The master content id is always -1.|
|paramname|The name of the parameter.|
|paramvalue|The value of the parameter.|

#### <a id="ie192970"></a>Example: 

```
SELECT * FROM gp_param_setting('max_connections');
```

### <a id="topic23"></a>gp\_param\_settings\_seg\_value\_diffs 

Server configuration parameters that are classified as *local* parameters \(meaning each segment gets the parameter value from its own `postgresql.conf` file\), should be set identically on all segments. This view shows local parameter settings that are inconsistent. Parameters that are supposed to have different values \(such as `port`\) are not included. This view is accessible to all users.

|Column|Description|
|------|-----------|
|psdname|The name of the parameter.|
|psdvalue|The value of the parameter.|
|psdcount|The number of segments that have this value.|

## <a id="topic24"></a>Checking for Failed Segments

|pgdbivalid|Is this segment up and valid? \(t or f\)|
|pgdbidefinedprimary|Was this segment assigned the role of primary at system initialization time? \(t or f\)|

## <a id="topic26x"></a>Checking Resource Group Activity and Status 

> **Note** The resource group activity and status views described in this section are valid only when resource group-based resource management is active.

Resource groups manage transactions to avoid exhausting system CPU and memory resources. Every database user is assigned a resource group. Greenplum Database evaluates every transaction submitted by a user against the limits configured for the user's resource group before running the transaction.

You can use the `gp_resgroup_config` view to check the configuration of each resource group. You can use the `gp_resgroup_status*` views to display the current transaction status and resource usage of each resource group.

-   [gp\_resgroup\_config](#topic27x)
-   [gp\_resgroup\_status](#topic31x)
-   [gp\_resgroup\_status\_per\_host](#perhost)
-   [gp\_resgroup\_status\_per\_segment](#perseg)

**Parent topic:** [The gp\_toolkit Administrative Schema](gp_toolkit.html)

### <a id="topic27x"></a>gp\_resgroup\_config 

The `gp_resgroup_config` view allows administrators to see the current CPU, memory, and concurrency limits for a resource group.

This view is accessible to all users.

|Column|Description|
|------|-----------|
|groupid|The ID of the resource group.|
|groupname|The name of the resource group.|
|concurrency|The concurrency \(`CONCURRENCY`\) value specified for the resource group.|
|cpu\_rate\_limit|The CPU limit \(`CPU_RATE_LIMIT`\) value specified for the resource group, or -1.|
|memory\_limit|The memory limit \(`MEMORY_LIMIT`\) value specified for the resource group.|
|memory\_shared\_quota|The shared memory quota \(`MEMORY_SHARED_QUOTA`\) value specified for the resource group.|
|memory\_spill\_ratio|The memory spill ratio \(`MEMORY_SPILL_RATIO`\) value specified for the resource group.|
|memory\_auditor|The memory auditor for the resource group.|
|cpuset|The CPU cores reserved for the resource group on the master host and segment hosts, or -1.|

### <a id="topic31x"></a>gp\_resgroup\_status 

The `gp_resgroup_status` view allows administrators to see status and activity for a resource group. It shows how many queries are waiting to run and how many queries are currently active in the system for each resource group. The view also displays current memory and CPU usage for the resource group.

> **Note** Resource groups use the Linux control groups \(cgroups\) configured on the host systems. The cgroups are used to manage host system resources. When resource groups use cgroups that are as part of a nested set of cgroups, resource group limits are relative to the parent cgroup allotment. For information about nested cgroups and Greenplum Database resource group limits, see [Using Resource Groups](../admin_guide/workload_mgmt_resgroups.html#topic8339intro).

This view is accessible to all users.

|Column|Description|
|------|-----------|
|rsgname|The name of the resource group.|
|groupid|The ID of the resource group.|
|num\_running|The number of transactions currently running in the resource group.|
|num\_queueing|The number of currently queued transactions for the resource group.|
|num\_queued|The total number of queued transactions for the resource group since the Greenplum Database cluster was last started, excluding the num\_queueing.|
|num\_executed|The total number of transactions run in the resource group since the Greenplum Database cluster was last started, excluding the num\_running.|
|total\_queue\_duration|The total time any transaction was queued since the Greenplum Database cluster was last started.|
|cpu\_usage|A set of key-value pairs. For each segment instance \(the key\), the value is the real-time, per-segment instance CPU core usage by a resource group. The value is the sum of the percentages \(as a decimal value\) of CPU cores that are used by the resource group for the segment instance.|
|memory\_usage|The real-time memory usage of the resource group on each Greenplum Database segment's host.|

The `cpu_usage` field is a JSON-formatted, key:value string that identifies, for each resource group, the per-segment instance CPU core usage. The key is the segment id. The value is the sum of the percentages \(as a decimal value\) of the CPU cores used by the segment instance's resource group on the segment host; the maximum value is 1.00. The total CPU usage of all segment instances running on a host should not exceed the `gp_resource_group_cpu_limit`. Example `cpu_usage` column output:

```

{"-1":0.01, "0":0.31, "1":0.31}
```

In the example, segment `0` and segment `1` are running on the same host; their CPU usage is the same.

The `memory_usage` field is also a JSON-formatted, key:value string. The string contents differ depending upon the type of resource group. For each resource group that you assign to a role \(default memory auditor `vmtracker`\), this string identifies the used and available fixed and shared memory quota allocations on each segment. The key is segment id. The values are memory values displayed in MB units. The following example shows `memory_usage` column output for a single segment for a resource group that you assign to a role:

```

"0":{"used":0, "available":76, "quota_used":-1, "quota_available":60, "shared_used":0, "shared_available":16}
```

For each resource group that you assign to an external component, the `memory_usage` JSON-formatted string identifies the memory used and the memory limit on each segment. The following example shows `memory_usage` column output for an external component resource group for a single segment:

```
"1":{"used":11, "limit_granted":15}
```

> **Note** See the `gp_resgroup_status_per_host` and `gp_resgroup_status_per_segment` views, described below, for more user-friendly display of CPU and memory usage.

### <a id="perhost"></a>gp\_resgroup\_status\_per\_host 

The [gp\_resgroup\_status\_per\_host](system_catalogs/gp_resgroup_status_per_host.html) view displays the real-time CPU and memory usage \(MBs\) for each resource group on a per-host basis.

## <a id="topic26"></a>Checking Resource Queue Activity and Status 

> **Note** The resource queue activity and status views described in this section are valid only when resource queue-based resource management is active.

The purpose of resource queues is to limit the number of active queries in the system at any given time in order to avoid exhausting system resources such as memory, CPU, and disk I/O. All database users are assigned to a resource queue, and every statement submitted by a user is first evaluated against the resource queue limits before it can run. The `gp_resq_*` family of views can be used to check the status of statements currently submitted to the system through their respective resource queue. Note that statements issued by superusers are exempt from resource queuing.

-   [gp\_resq\_activity](#topic27)
-   [gp\_resq\_activity\_by\_queue](#topic28)
-   [gp\_resq\_priority\_statement](#topic29)
-   [gp\_resq\_role](#topic30)
-   [gp\_resqueue\_status](#topic31)

The *gp\_workfile\_\** views show information about all the queries that are currently using disk spill space. Greenplum Database creates work files on disk if it does not have sufficient memory to run the query in memory. This information can be used for troubleshooting and tuning queries. The information in the views can also be used to specify the values for the Greenplum Database configuration parameters `gp_workfile_limit_per_query` and `gp_workfile_limit_per_segment`.

## <a id="topic36"></a>Viewing Users and Groups \(Roles\) 

It is frequently convenient to group users \(roles\) together to ease management of object privileges: that way, privileges can be granted to, or revoked from, a group as a whole. In Greenplum Database this is done by creating a role that represents the group, and then granting membership in the group role to individual user roles.

The [gp\_roles\_assigned](#topic37) view can be used to see all of the roles in the system, and their assigned members \(if the role is also a group role\).

**Parent topic:** [The gp\_toolkit Administrative Schema](gp_toolkit.html)

### <a id="topic37"></a>gp\_roles\_assigned

## <a id="topic38"></a>Checking Database Object Sizes and Disk Space 

The `gp_size_*` family of views can be used to determine the disk space usage for a distributed Greenplum Database, schema, table, or index. The following views calculate the total size of an object across all primary segments \(mirrors are not included in the size calculations\).

> **Note** By default, the `gp_size_*` views do not display data for materialized views. Refer to [Including Data for Materialized Views](#topic_matview) for instructions on adding this data to `gp_size_*` view output.

-   [gp\_size\_of\_all\_table\_indexes](#topic39)
-   [gp\_size\_of\_database](#topic40)
-   [gp\_size\_of\_index](#topic41)
-   [gp\_size\_of\_partition\_and\_indexes\_disk](#topic42)

-   [gp\_size\_of\_table\_disk](#topic46)
-   [gp\_size\_of\_table\_uncompressed](#topic47)
-   [gp\_disk\_free](#topic48)

The table and index sizing views list the relation by object ID \(not by name\). To check the size of a table or index by name, you must look up the relation name \(`relname`\) in the `pg_class` table. For example:

```
SELECT relname as name, sotdsize as size, sotdtoastsize as 
toast, sotdadditionalsize as other 
FROM gp_size_of_table_disk as sotd, pg_class 
WHERE sotd.sotdoid=pg_class.oid ORDER BY relname;

## <a id="topic49"></a>Checking for Uneven Data Distribution 

All tables in Greenplum Database are distributed, meaning their data is divided across all of the segments in the system. If the data is not distributed evenly, then query processing performance may decrease. The following views can help diagnose if a table has uneven data distribution:

-   [gp\_skew\_coefficients](#topic50)
-   [gp\_skew\_idle\_fractions](#topic51)

> **Note** By default, the `gp_skew_*` views do not display data for materialized views. Refer to [Including Data for Materialized Views](#topic_matview) for instructions on adding this data to `gp_skew_*` view output.

**Parent topic:** [The gp\_toolkit Administrative Schema](gp_toolkit.html)

### <a id="topic50"></a>gp\_skew\_coefficients

## <a id="topic_matview"></a>Including Data for Materialized Views 

You must update a `gp_toolkit` internal view if you want data about materialized views to be included in the output of relevant `gp_toolkit` views.

Run the following SQL commands as the Greenplum Database administrator to update the internal view:

```
CREATE or REPLACE VIEW gp_toolkit.__gp_user_tables
AS
    SELECT
        fn.fnnspname as autnspname,
        fn.fnrelname as autrelname,
        relkind as autrelkind,
        reltuples as autreltuples,
        relpages as autrelpages,
        relacl as autrelacl,
        pgc.oid as autoid,
        pgc.reltoastrelid as auttoastoid,
