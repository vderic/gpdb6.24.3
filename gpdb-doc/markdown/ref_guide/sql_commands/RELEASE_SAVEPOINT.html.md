title: RELEASE SAVEPOINT 
---

Destroys a previously defined savepoint.

## <a id="section2"></a>Synopsis 

``` {#sql_command_synopsis}
RELEASE [SAVEPOINT] <savepoint_name>
```

## <a id="section3"></a>Description 

`RELEASE SAVEPOINT` destroys a savepoint previously defined in the current transaction.

Destroying a savepoint makes it unavailable as a rollback point, but it has no other user visible behavior. It does not undo the effects of commands run after the savepoint was established. \(To do that, see [ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT](ROLLBACK_TO_SAVEPOINT.html).\) Destroying a savepoint when it is no longer needed may allow the system to reclaim some resources earlier than transaction end.

`RELEASE SAVEPOINT` also destroys all savepoints that were established *after* the named savepoint was established.

## <a id="section4"></a>Parameters 

savepoint\_name
:   The name of the savepoint to destroy.

## <a id="section5"></a>Examples 

To establish and later destroy a savepoint:

```
BEGIN;
    INSERT INTO table1 VALUES (3);
    SAVEPOINT my_savepoint;
    INSERT INTO table1 VALUES (4);
    RELEASE SAVEPOINT my_savepoint;
COMMIT;
```

The above transaction will insert both 3 and 4.

## <a id="section6"></a>Compatibility 

This command conforms to the SQL standard. The standard specifies that the key word `SAVEPOINT` is mandatory, but Greenplum Database allows it to be omitted.
