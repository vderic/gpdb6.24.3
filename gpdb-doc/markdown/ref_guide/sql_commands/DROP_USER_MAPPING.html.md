`DROP USER MAPPING` removes an existing user mapping from a foreign server. To run this command, the current user must be the owner of the server containing the mapping.

## <a id="section4"></a>Parameters 

IF EXISTS
:   Do not throw an error if the user mapping does not exist. Greenplum Database issues a notice in this case.

username
:   User name of the mapping. `CURRENT_USER` and `USER` match the name of the current user. `PUBLIC` is used to match all present and future user names in the system.

servername
:   Server name of the user mapping.

Drop the user mapping named `bob`, server `foo` if it exists:

```
DROP USER MAPPING IF EXISTS FOR bob SERVER foo;
```
