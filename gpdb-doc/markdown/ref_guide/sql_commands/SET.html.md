title: SET

Changes the value of a Greenplum Database configuration parameter.

## <a id="section2"></a>Synopsis 

``` {#sql_command_synopsis}
SET [SESSION | LOCAL] <configuration_parameter> {TO | =} <value> | 
    '<value>' | DEFAULT}

SET [SESSION | LOCAL] TIME ZONE {<timezone> | LOCAL | DEFAULT}
```

## <a id="section3"></a>Description 

The `SET` command changes server configuration parameters. Any configuration parameter classified as a session parameter can be changed on-the-fly with `SET`. `SET` affects only the value used by the current session.

If `SET` or `SET SESSION` is issued within a transaction that is later cancelled, the effects of the `SET` command disappear when the transaction is rolled back. Once the surrounding transaction is committed, the effects will persist until the end of the session, unless overridden by another `SET`.

The effects of `SET LOCAL` last only till the end of the current transaction, whether committed or not. A special case is `SET` followed by `SET LOCAL` within a single transaction: the `SET LOCAL` value will be seen until the end of the transaction, but afterwards \(if the transaction is committed\) the `SET` value will take effect.

If `SET LOCAL` is used within a function that includes a `SET` option for the same configuration parameter \(see [CREATE FUNCTION](CREATE_FUNCTION.html)\), the effects of the `SET LOCAL` command disappear at function exit; the value in effect when the function was called is restored anyway. This allows `SET LOCAL` to be used for dynamic or repeated changes of a parameter within a function, while retaining the convenience of using the `SET` option to save and restore the caller's value. Note that a regular `SET` command overrides any surrounding function's `SET` option; its effects persist unless rolled back.

If you create a cursor with the `DECLARE` command in a transaction, you cannot use the `SET` command in the transaction until you close the cursor with the `CLOSE` command.

See [Server Configuration Parameters](../config_params/guc_config.html) for information about server parameters.

## <a id="section4"></a>Parameters 

SESSION
:   Specifies that the command takes effect for the current session. This is the default.

LOCAL
:   Specifies that the command takes effect for only the current transaction. After `COMMIT` or `ROLLBACK`, the session-level setting takes effect again. Note that `SET LOCAL` will appear to have no effect if it is run outside of a transaction.

configuration\_parameter
:   The name of a Greenplum Database configuration parameter. Only parameters classified as *session* can be changed with `SET`. See [Server Configuration Parameters](../config_params/guc_config.html) for details.

value
:   New value of parameter. Values can be specified as string constants, identifiers, numbers, or comma-separated lists of these. `DEFAULT` can be used to specify resetting the parameter to its default value. If specifying memory sizing or time units, enclose the value in single quotes.

TIME ZONE
:   `SET TIME ZONE` value is an alias for `SET timezone TO value`. The syntax `SET TIME ZONE` allows special syntax for the time zone specification. Here are examples of valid values:

:   `'PST8PDT'`

:   `'Europe/Rome'`

:   `-7` \(time zone 7 hours west from UTC\)

:   `INTERVAL '-08:00' HOUR TO MINUTE` \(time zone 8 hours west from UTC\).

LOCAL
DEFAULT
:   Set the time zone to your local time zone \(that is, server's default value of timezone\). See the [Time zone section of the PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/datatype-datetime.html#DATATYPE-TIMEZONES) for more information about time zones in Greenplum Database.

## <a id="section5"></a>Examples 

Set the schema search path:

```
SET search_path TO my_schema, public;
```

Increase the segment host memory per query to 200 MB:

```
SET statement_mem TO '200MB';
```

Set the style of date to traditional POSTGRES with "day before month" input convention:

```
SET datestyle TO postgres, dmy;
```

Set the time zone for San Mateo, California \(Pacific Time\):

```
SET TIME ZONE 'PST8PDT';
```

Set the time zone for Italy:

```
SET TIME ZONE 'Europe/Rome'; 
```

## <a id="section6"></a>Compatibility 

`SET TIME ZONE` extends syntax defined in the SQL standard. The standard allows only numeric time zone offsets while Greenplum Database allows more flexible time-zone specifications. All other `SET` features are Greenplum Database extensions.
