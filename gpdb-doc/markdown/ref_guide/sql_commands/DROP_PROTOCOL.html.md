You must be a superuser or the protocol owner to drop a protocol.

**Warning:** If you drop a data access prococol, external tables that have been defined with the protocol will no longer be able to access the external data source.

:   Do not throw an error if the protocol does not exist. A notice is issued in this case.

Shared libraries that were used by the protocol should also be removed from the Greenplum Database hosts.
