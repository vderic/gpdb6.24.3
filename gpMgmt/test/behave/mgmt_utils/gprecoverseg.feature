Feature: gprecoverseg tests

    Scenario: incremental recovery works with tablespaces
        Given the database is running
          And a tablespace is created with data
          And user stops all primary processes
          And user can start transactions
         When the user runs "gprecoverseg -a"
         Then gprecoverseg should return a return code of 0
          And the segments are synchronized
          And the tablespace is valid

        Given another tablespace is created with data
         When the user runs "gprecoverseg -ra"
         Then gprecoverseg should return a return code of 0
          And the segments are synchronized
          And the tablespace is valid
          And the other tablespace is valid

    Scenario: full recovery works with tablespaces
        Given the database is running
          And a tablespace is created with data
          And user stops all primary processes
          And user can start transactions
         When the user runs "gprecoverseg -a -F"
         Then gprecoverseg should return a return code of 0
          And the segments are synchronized
          And the tablespace is valid

        Given another tablespace is created with data
         When the user runs "gprecoverseg -ra"
         Then gprecoverseg should return a return code of 0
          And the segments are synchronized
          And the tablespace is valid
          And the other tablespace is valid

    Scenario Outline: full recovery limits number of parallel processes correctly

        And 2 gprecoverseg directory under '/tmp/recoverseg' with mode '0700' is created
        And a good gprecoverseg input file is created for moving 2 mirrors
        When the user runs gprecoverseg with input file and additional args "-a -F -v <args>"
        Then gprecoverseg should return a return code of 0
        And gprecoverseg should only spawn up to <master_workers> workers in WorkerPool
        And check if gprecoverseg ran "$GPHOME/sbin/gpsegsetuprecovery.py" 1 times with args "-b <segHost_workers>"
        And check if gprecoverseg ran "$GPHOME/sbin/gpsegrecovery.py" 1 times with args "-b <segHost_workers>"
        And gpsegsetuprecovery should only spawn up to <segHost_workers> workers in WorkerPool

        And check if gprecoverseg ran "$GPHOME/sbin/gpsegstop.py" 1 times with args "-b <segHost_workers>"
        And the segments are synchronized
        And check segment conf: postgresql.conf

      Examples:
        | args      | master_workers | segHost_workers |
        | -B 1 -b 1 |  1             |  1              |

    Scenario Outline: <scenario> recovery skips unreachable segments
      Given the database is running
      And all the segments are running
      And the segments are synchronized

      And the primary on content 0 is stopped
      And user can start transactions
      And the primary on content 1 is stopped
      And user can start transactions
      And the status of the primary on content 0 should be "d"
      And the status of the primary on content 1 should be "d"

      And the host for the primary on content 1 is made unreachable

      And the user runs psql with "-c 'CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS test_recoverseg (i int)'" against database "postgres"
      And the user runs psql with "-c 'INSERT INTO test_recoverseg SELECT generate_series(1, 10000)'" against database "postgres"

      When the user runs "gprecoverseg <args>"
      Then gprecoverseg should print "Not recovering segment \d because invalid_host is unreachable" to stdout
      And the user runs psql with "-c 'SELECT gp_request_fts_probe_scan()'" against database "postgres"
      And the status of the primary on content 0 should be "u"
      And the status of the primary on content 1 should be "d"

      # Rebalance all possible segments and skip unreachable segment pairs.
      When the user runs "gprecoverseg -ar"
      Then gprecoverseg should return a return code of 0
      And gprecoverseg should print "Not rebalancing primary segment dbid \d with its mirror dbid \d because one is either down, unreachable, or not synchronized" to stdout
      And content 0 is balanced
      And content 1 is unbalanced

      And the user runs psql with "-c 'DROP TABLE test_recoverseg'" against database "postgres"
      And the cluster is returned to a good state
