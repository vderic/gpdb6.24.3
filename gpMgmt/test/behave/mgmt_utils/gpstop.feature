Feature: gpstop behave tests

    @concourse_cluster
    @demo_cluster
    Scenario: gpstop succeeds
        Given the database is running
          And running postgres processes are saved in context
         When the user runs "gpstop -a"
         Then gpstop should return a return code of 0
         And verify no postgres process is running on all hosts

    @concourse_cluster
    @demo_cluster
    Scenario: when there are user connections gpstop waits to shutdown until user switches to fast mode
        Given the database is running
          And the user asynchronously runs "psql postgres" and the process is saved
          And running postgres processes are saved in context
         When the user runs gpstop -a -t 4 --skipvalidation and selects f
          And gpstop should print "'\(s\)mart_mode', '\(f\)ast_mode', '\(i\)mmediate_mode'" to stdout
         Then gpstop should return a return code of 0
         And verify no postgres process is running on all hosts

    @concourse_cluster
    @demo_cluster
    Scenario: when there are user connections gpstop waits to shutdown until user connections are disconnected
        Given the database is running
          And the user asynchronously runs "psql postgres" and the process is saved
          And the user asynchronously sets up to end that process in 15 seconds
          And running postgres processes are saved in context
         When the user runs gpstop -a -t 2 --skipvalidation and selects s
          And gpstop should print "There were 1 user connections at the start of the shutdown" to stdout
          And gpstop should print "'\(s\)mart_mode', '\(f\)ast_mode', '\(i\)mmediate_mode'" to stdout
         Then gpstop should return a return code of 0
         And verify no postgres process is running on all hosts

    @demo_cluster
    Scenario: gpstop succeeds even if the standby host is unreachable
        Given the database is running
          And the catalog has a standby master entry
         When the standby host is made unreachable
          And the user runs "gpstop -a"
         Then gpstop should print "Standby is unreachable, skipping shutdown on standby" to stdout
          And gpstop should print "invalid_host is unreachable.Skipping cleaning shared memory." to stdout
          And gpstop should return a return code of 0
          And the standby host is made reachable

    @demo_cluster
    Scenario: gpstop succeeds when pg_ctl command fails
        Given the database is running
          And the user runs psql with "-c "CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS gp_inject_fault;"" against database "postgres"
          And the user runs psql with "-c "SELECT gp_inject_fault('checkpoint', 'sleep', '', '', '', 1, -1, 3600, dbid) FROM gp_segment_configuration"" against database "postgres"
          And running postgres processes are saved in context
         When the user runs "gpstop -a -M fast"
          And gpstop should print "Failed to shutdown master with pg_ctl." to stdout
          And gpstop should return a return code of 0
          And verify no postgres process is running on all hosts

    @demo_cluster
    Scenario: gpstop succeeds with immediate option
        Given the database is running
          And the user asynchronously runs "psql postgres" and the process is saved
          And the user asynchronously sets up to end that process in 15 seconds
          And running postgres processes are saved in context
         When the user runs "gpstop -a -M immediate"
          And gpstop should print "Commencing Master instance shutdown with mode='immediate'" to stdout
         Then gpstop should return a return code of 0
          And verify no postgres process is running on all hosts
